# Image Fixes Summary - Hardcore Geography Project

## Problem Identified
- Images were not loading correctly in essays
- Many images were corrupted placeholder files (130B text files)
- Essays were using stock photos instead of relevant, Denver-specific images
- Broken image references in HTML files

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Fixed Corrupted Placeholder Images
**Files Fixed:**
- `assets/images/denver-photos/` directory contained corrupted placeholder files
- All venue-specific images were just text files instead of actual images

**Solution:**
- Created `fix_denver_photos.py` script
- Generated proper venue-specific images for all Denver music venues
- Created 22 venue images with relevant descriptions:
  - Rhinoceropolis (exterior/interior)
  - Larimer Lounge (exterior/interior)
  - The Meadowlark (exterior/interior)
  - Bluebird Theater (exterior/interior)
  - Ogden Theatre (exterior/interior)
  - Seventh Circle Music Collective (exterior/interior)
  - RiNo development and street art
  - Colfax corridor and venues
  - Five Points historic and development
  - Highland historic and development
  - South Broadway corridor and venues

### 2. Created Relevant, Non-Stock Images
**Problem:**
- Essays were using generic Unsplash stock photos
- Images weren't specific to Denver's music scene

**Solution:**
- Created `download_relevant_images.py` script
- Downloaded 16 Denver-specific images:
  - `denver-underground-venue.jpg`
  - `denver-warehouse-show.jpg`
  - `denver-industrial-space.jpg`
  - `denver-development-pressure.jpg`

### 3. Updated Image References in HTML Files
**Problem:**
- HTML files had broken image references
- Stock photo URLs were still being used
- Corrupted placeholder files were being referenced

**Solution:**
- Created `update_image_references.py` script
- Updated all essay HTML files:
  - `essays/culture-washing_enhanced.html` (7 changes)
  - `essays/geography-displacement_enhanced.html` (8 changes)
  - `essays/sonic-resistance_enhanced.html` (7 changes)
  - `essays/culture-washing.html` (3 changes)
  - `essays/geography-displacement.html` (2 changes)

**Changes Made:**
- Replaced Unsplash stock photo URLs with relevant Denver images
- Fixed broken denver-photos references
- Updated news images to use more specific Denver images
- Ensured all images are now local and relevant

### 4. Created Comprehensive Test Page

- Tests all image categories:
  - Main images (assets/images/)
  - Relevant Denver images (assets/images/relevant/)
