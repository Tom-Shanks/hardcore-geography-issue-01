# Photo Improvement Plan for Hardcore Geography Essays

## Current Status: Photos Online ✅
All 3 enhanced essays have photos implemented with responsive design and accessibility features.

## Issues Identified

### 1. Generic Stock Photos
**Problem**: Using Unsplash stock photos instead of authentic local content
**Impact**: Reduces credibility and local authenticity
**Solution**: Replace with actual venue photos, flyers, and local documentation

### 2. Limited Historical Documentation
**Problem**: Missing archival photos from the actual venues and time periods
**Impact**: Loses connection to real Denver DIY history
**Solution**: Integrate existing flyer archive and venue documentation

### 3. Inconsistent Photo Quality
**Problem**: Some photos are too generic or don't match venue descriptions
**Impact**: Weakens academic rigor and local authenticity
**Solution**: Curate photos that match specific venues and time periods

## Proposed Solutions Using Existing Codebase

### Solution 1: Integrate Flyer Archive
**Source**: `/assets/flyers/` directory with decade-organized flyers
**Implementation**:
- Extract high-quality flyer scans for venue galleries
- Use flyers as historical documentation in essays
- Create flyer galleries for each major venue mentioned

### Solution 2: Use Interactive Map Screenshots
**Source**: `/assets/interactive-map.html` and `/assets/maps/`
**Implementation**:
- Capture map screenshots showing venue locations
- Use zoning map overlays to show displacement patterns
- Create before/after development comparison images

### Solution 3: Leverage Data Visualizations
**Source**: `/data/` directory with venue database
**Implementation**:
- Generate charts showing venue closure patterns
- Create timeline visualizations of displacement
- Use geographic data to create custom maps

### Solution 4: Integrate Research Documentation
**Source**: `/research/` and `/content/` directories
**Implementation**:
- Use academic source images where appropriate
- Include planning document screenshots
- Add zoning code excerpts as visual elements

## Implementation Priority

### Phase 1: Quick Wins (1-2 days)
1. **Replace generic photos** with flyer archive content
2. **Add map screenshots** from interactive map
3. **Improve alt-text** for better accessibility

### Phase 2: Enhanced Content (3-5 days)
1. **Create venue-specific galleries** using flyer archive
2. **Generate data visualizations** from venue database
3. **Add historical timeline images** showing displacement patterns

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (1 week)
1. **Interactive photo galleries** with lightbox functionality
2. **Before/after development comparisons**
3. **Geographic visualization integration**
