# Hardcore Geography: Sonic Archaeology of Denver's DIY Displacement

**Live Site**: [https://hardcore-geography-issue-01.github.io](https://hardcore-geography-issue-01.github.io)

A multi-format research project documenting the systematic displacement of Denver's DIY music venues through geographic analysis, audio archaeology, and community resistance. This repository contains the complete web presence for the Hardcore Geography project, featuring three academic essays, an interactive venue map, data downloads, and comprehensive documentation.

## Project Overview

Hardcore Geography combines academic research with hardcore aesthetic to examine how municipal zoning codes, real estate speculation, and planning policy collaborate to eliminate spaces of cultural resistance. Through essays, interactive mapping, audio documentation, and print publication, we trace the sonic archaeology of gentrification and document strategies of underground persistence.

### Research Outputs

- **Three Academic Essays** (5,099 words total)
  - The Geography of Displacement
